Q5 : Define Favicon logo and give an illustrative example?

Ans 5: The small graphical representation of the website you are visiting, which is visible on the left to the website’s name in the address bar, is called a favicon. It is a shortened expression for ‘favorite icon.’ It helps you identify the visited website among the many open tabs. For example, The fancy P that appears on the tab left of the ProCreator website’s address bar is our favicon.
    People tend to confuse it with the logo. It can or cannot resemble the logo, but the intent of both of these a very different. Favicons 
 are generally a square of  16 x 16 px used by web browsers. However, the size can vary when you design the favicon for a mobile screen. On a mobile screen, the favicon is the favorite app you set on your home screen.

 Examples:-
      1.   Google makes use of a circle with a G written inside it.
      2.   Facebook makes use of its logo itself, with an alternate color scheme.
      3.   Amazon also makes use of a square with an ‘A’ written inside, resonating with the first letter of their logo.
